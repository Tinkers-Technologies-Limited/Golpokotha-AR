## The Problem 

The children studying primary and pre-primary levels in Bangladesh aged 4-12 years are in dire need of personalized fun and interactive learning materials and self-learning support to ensure learners’ verbal, mental, intellectual growth and development. Although the number of teachers in schools in Bangladesh has increased compared to the past, one teacher can't meet the learning needs of all the students in the classroom. Lack of fun and interactive learning materials and the teacher's inability to teach in many cases hinder the student's social and value education. Thus, not being able to learn in class creates distance, fear, annoyance with learning, which results in many children dropping out after finishing primary education. According to a survey by Tinkers, Primary School teachers in Bangladesh are assuming that many children will not return to school when the lockdown of Covid 19 is over. Learning is now fearsome, dull, and not fun. 



## The Solution 

An augmented reality spatial storytelling, animated storybook-based learning platform with personalized learning activities and assessments using Artificial Intelligence to ensure 4-12 age childs’ verbal, mental, intellectual growth and development. An augmented reality app that aims to reimagine children’s learning by engaging, mobilizing, and empowering its narrator, all while building confidence in reading aloud, interacting and blending into the story, empowering kids to navigate their own journey. Children learn a lot from a story, Build empathy for the character, and shape their life from the learning of the stories.  From our app, children will learn learning outcomes, value education, and social norms through play. In addition to school reading, the storytelling app will be a medium of continuous education for the child. Self-learning will take the child one step further from childhood. Students who cannot go to school will also learn these basic things with us through this app with fun. Children in primary and pre-primary can learn and achieve the learning outcomes and basics of their curriculum through stories. The learner should achieve the expected learning outcomes and values through different learning activities, interacting with different characters of those stories.


## The Demo Story: A Beautiful World


```
A very large tree in the desert is almost dead.
 
Mr. Tree - (Dead tree shakes its head a little) Where am I! Why the desert around! (The tree will then look at the user and say in a tired voice) And hello little friend I'm Kirena, I'm so hungry will you give me some water?
 
The user's screen will say - "Take this water for you" 
(It will rain like rain on the tree as you read)
 
Mr. Tree - (drinks water and calms down) Thank you, little friend, how are you?
 
User - I'm fine!
 
Mr. Tree - but I'm not good. My mind is very bad.
 
User - Why are you upset?
 
Mr. Tree - he talks a lot! (Happily) I was once as young as you. I am now 150 years old. Do you know how I grew up?
 
User - How did you get so big?
 
Mr. Tree - Listen, one day when I was very young, a kind man planted me in his home garden.
 
User - Is that how you grew up?
 
Mr. Tree - No, the tree needs care and water to grow.
 
TAP water pots and help us grow with more water!
 
Mr. Tree - Ah thanks! You see, I had many brothers and sisters and friends with me before. But now I am alone! Do you know where they are now?
 
User - I don't know where they are now!
 
Mr. Trees - I don't even know where they are now, maybe no one is left! (Frustrated) Ah, how beautiful the world was before!
 
User - What was the world like before?
 
Mr. Trees - Not so long ago the earth was like this, (bright eyes) the earth was surrounded by many beautiful greenery. Then we were all alive. We got regular food and our trees were full of flowers and fruits.
 
User- I like flowers, I like to eat fruits. But what is the food you need?
 
Mr. Trees - The main food of trees is water.
 
User - Oops! You don't eat anything else?
 
M. Trees - We also absorb carbon dioxide and provide you with the oxygen you need. Our contribution to temperature balance is incomparable. The birds use our twigs as their nests.
 
User- Wow! What else can you do?
 
Mr. Trees - We clean pollution from the air. Our roots hold the soil and make it strong, it prevents landslides and earthquake-resistant soil erosion.
 
User: Then why are you in the desert today? And why are you in this situation?
 
Mr. Tree - There are many big natural storms every year, and many of us have died in those storms.
 
User - What happened then?
 
Mr. Tree - People also used us to cut down buildings for their needs, build buildings there, urbanize. Merciful people reduced the care of the tree. There was no one else on earth to plant trees.
 
User: Is that how you all died?
 
Mr. Trees - That's right, that's how we became extinct one by one.
 
User - Oh no! Is this why the world is becoming a desert?
 
Mr. Tree - Yes! As we died, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air increased dramatically, causing global warming. And the earth is losing its natural balance and today the world is going to turn into a desert.
 
User- How can we get rid of this now.
 
Mr. Tree - You can easily get rid of these little friends!
 
User - so! Please tell me soon!
 
Mr. Trees - If you take care of the trees and plant a lot of trees, then the world will easily become beautiful again.
 
Keep tapping to plant more trees.
 
Then as soon as the user taps there will be a tree and at the end there will be a scene of beautiful world.
 
Mr. Tree - Thank you little friend for building a beautiful world!
 
```




## App Prototype Video 

We have build only a small demo of the app. You can see the app prototype video here https://youtu.be/hAGfZvnoVXM

## How we are using the Technology 

An augmented reality spatial storytelling, animated storybook-based learning platform with personalized learning activities and assessments using Artificial Intelligence to ensure 4-12 age childs’ verbal, mental, intellectual growth and development. An augmented reality app that aims to reimagine children’s learning by engaging, mobilizing, and empowering its narrator, all while building confidence in reading aloud, interacting and blending into the story, empowering kids to navigate their own journey.


Users of our app are mainly  4-12 years aged primary and pre-primary school children. However, parents and teachers can also be our users to help them. We will launch our app for Android and iOS platforms. We will create characters and their environments for our stories through 3D modeling, rigging, and animation according to the level and learning outcomes we have created. We will then build our stories into a world of augmented reality by implementing our stories into the Unity 3D game engine. We will use a variety of APIs, including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, for child-friendly interactions, Personalized teaching, and learning activities among the stories, many types of in-story and after assessment. Here in our prototype, We are using natural language processing to do speech recognition. When the user says the sentence it creates an audio file containing the speech. Then the file goes through the Wit AI API and the server sends an accurate data depending on the actual sentence and the sentence told by the user. If the accuracy becomes greater or equal to a certain threshold, the app continues, otherwise, the user needs to try again the whole step for the sentence. If our character asks any question to a child thus the answer will be first converted to text from speech then we will check the correct answer. This is an augmented reality storybook platform that transforms ordinary spaces into extraordinary stories.

## The Results Initial Prototyping:

Firstly We did a survey to understand this problem at the very beginning of prototyping. In June 2021, amid the COVID 19, pandemic Tinkers Surveyed a total of 200 teachers, parents, students, and vulnerable children to learn about the current status of learning and learning quality in Pre-primary and Primary classrooms of Bangladesh. We found out that 72.54% of teachers think the teacher-student ratio in their classroom is not appropriate. 70.58% of teachers think an inappropriate teacher-student ratio affects the student's learning. 55.88% of teachers think In the classroom of this large number of students, his/her role as a teacher achieving the terminal competency of each student is not enough. 78.43% of teachers think there is a huge chance of dropout of students after this covid situation.77.77% of parents think teaching given by the teacher in the classroom alone is not enough for the proper development of the child

The details of the survey are here. https://cutt.ly/qedsurvey

Then we build a prototype of our app based on all this information. The live data of the  can be seen here https://cutt.ly/golpokothaAR

Our prototype is lean. We need funds for making this app with perfection. We shared our prototype app with some parents, teachers, and kids. We asked them for feedback about this prototype. They loved our idea and the app. They loved the idea of our app contributing to self-learning with an interactive augmented reality journey. They told us this is the future of augmented reality and alignment with the education system.
